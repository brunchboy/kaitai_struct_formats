  These files are created by rekordbox when analyzing audio tracks
  to facilitate DJ performance. They include waveforms, beat grids
  (information about the precise time at which each beat occurs),
  time indices to allow efficient seeking to specific positions
  inside variable bit-rate audio streams, and lists of memory cues
  and loop points. They are used by Pioneer professional DJ
  equipment.

  The format has been reverse-engineered to facilitate sophisticated
  integrations with light and laser shows, videos, and other musical
  instruments, by supporting deep knowledge of what is playing and
  what is coming next through monitoring the network communications
  of the players.
